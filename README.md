tic-tac-toe
===========
A game of tic tac toe written in JavaScript for my [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) application. 

There are four choices for opponents: 

* Human (on same computer)
* Hard AI

    An AI player that uses the [minimax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm with [alpha-beta pruning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) to explore the full game depth. Guarenteed to win or draw.   

* Medium AI    

    Similar to Hard AI player, but depth is limited to 2, meaning it only looks two moves in advance. 

* Random AI

    An AI player that picks a random empty square to play in. Often loses.
